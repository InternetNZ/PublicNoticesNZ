# NZ Gazette Tweeter / Public Notices

Applies [feedr](https://github.com/housed/feedr) to generate a Twitter feed of notices from the NZ Gazette, which is where the NZ Government officially announces things.

Currently works to get feeds, but is likely to dump lots of tweets at once in a way that we might not want.

# Feedr project self-description: 

feedr will read RSS feeds that you specify and then it will determine if there's new content since last checked. If there is, then it will publish a post on your Twitter account on your behalf for each new content update.

As is, feedr will add the following information to a tweet:
* Title of the new content entry
* URL to the new content entry
* Relevant hashtag(s)
* Relevant image

Here's [an example of feedr in action](https://twitter.com/ValveTime/status/552918907053674496)...
